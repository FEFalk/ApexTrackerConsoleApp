# Apex Tracker Service

This application handles all logic behind game sessions in the Apex Tracker website.
It updates scores of players and squads in realtime and updates the centralized database with the information so that it can be presented in the frontend.

The data is fetched from the integrated API from Respawn, which is quite limited on its own.
